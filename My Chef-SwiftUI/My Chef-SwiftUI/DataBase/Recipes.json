Finally, pour in the vegetable or chicken broth, and allow the sauce to reduce down slightly. \n3. At the same time, boil water in another pot and cook the pasta of your choice.\n4. Reduce heat to low, add the heavy cream, and bring to a gentle simmer while stirring occasionally. Season the cream sauce with salt and pepper. Add in the baby spinach and allow to wilt in the sauce, and add in the parmesan cheese. Allow the cream sauce to simmer for a further minute until cheese melts through. \n5.
